-[ Future ]-----------------------------------------

This is the last version i will release, but also the source code is attached
so any bug's discovered you can fix your self :)

I have a lot more of the save filed mapped, but pure laziness and a lack of time
stop me from bothering with it, i only added the most basic stuff, but anybody
with free time could really increase the potential of the editor a lot.

Enjoy!
